Location Class:
 - has two attributes, latitude and longitude
periNode Class:
 - Has three attributes as a doubly linked list of locations

>>fDistance(loc1,loc2)
returns the distance in meters between two loc classes

>>cPos(mypos,locArray,distance) 
returns an array of Location class for all locations within distance of mypos(as location)

>>bPerim(locArray)
returns a list of perionodes as the perimeter of the locArrary of locations
USE THIS for any function requiring a perimeter build of a locArrary

returns a new locarray of locations where the perimeter created by locarry is expanded by distance(can be negative or positive)

>>cPeridistance(perimeter)
Returns the distance[[m] of the perimeter passed

>>areaNpoly(perimeter)
returns a area[m^2]  of the perimeter passed


>>function getCloc(locarray)
returns a string ",long1,lat1,long2,lat2,.....,lonn,latn"
